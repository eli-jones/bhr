# Getting Started with Jammming

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project. This is my final project for Codecademy's Front End Web Development career path. It is not complete at this time (I have included a to-do list in this file below), but this is a mostly complete, static version of this site.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- Will include Redux
- Will include Adopt A Pet API

### What I learned

So far, I have learned a lot about well-organized file structures, brushed up on my React navigation, and how to create a 404 page. I've created all of the content and graphic design as well as having sourced the pictures from Pexels.

### Continued development
I would like to update the featured pets of the home page and the success stories on the about page to be carousels. I tried a few options, but they did not work, so I will scrap all of the code I have written for those sections and try again to make sure the content I already had written wasn't causing problems. I also need to use Redux and Adopt A Pet's API to create content for the available pets page. I also would like the site to have a dummy contact form and footer, but will need to return to that later.
